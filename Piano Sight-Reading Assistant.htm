<h3 style="text-align:center;">ECE 5760 Final Project, Spring '15</h3>

<div class="container" id="intro">
  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Our project connects a VGA monitor and a keyboard to an FPGA on an Altera DE2 development board
  to increase the usability of the system.  By simulating a traditional command line interface on the
  screen, we have allowed users to perform some operations on the fly without having to compile and
  upload code every time.  Additionally, we utilized the DE2 board’s inbuilt SD card reader to allow
  users to import, manipulate, and save portable data, effectively creating a file system for the FPGA.</p>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/screen.jpg" alt="shiftreg" align="middle" width="500"> </p>
</div>

<div class="container" id="design">
<h3>Design</h3>
<small><a href="#desinterface">Block Diagram</a> | <a href="#desconnections">Connections</a> | <a href="#descomm">Communication</a> | <a href="#dessound">Sound</a> | <a href="#desdiff">Difficulties &amp; Choices</a></small>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/block_diagram.png" alt="block diagram" width="700"></p>
<p>The hardware interface consists of an FPGA on the DE2 board with an SD card reader connected to a PS2 keyboard and a VGA monitor.
We use a Pancake processor running on the FPGA to interface between the software (Syrup) and hardware (Verilog) components of our design.
The FPGA accepts user input via the keyboard, interprets and processes the command through Pancake, and outputs the I/O through a command
line interface (CLI) displayed on the VGA, in a way reminiscent of personal computers of yore.  The SD card reader sends and receives it
data in the same fashion.</p>

<br><h4 id="desinterface">Block Diagram</h4>
<p>The interface consists solely of one microcontroller (ATMEGA 1284p)
connected to a TV screen via NTSC. It is connected to the keyboard via
serial connection to the other 1284p that we are using. The interface is
 responsible for displaying music, updating music, and calculating score
 based on keyboard input via serial connection.</p>
<p>The sheet music is displayed in the following fashion:
</p><ol>
  <li>Note structures are created in order for the entire song.
  </li><li>Notes are placed sequentially until their total value is more than a full measure.
  </li><li>A measure (bar) line is placed and the beat is reset
  </li><li>Numbers 2 and 3 are repeated until the line is full.
  </li><li>A new line is started and steps 2 through 4 are repeated until the page is full (or the last note is drawn).
  </li><li>Staff lines and clefs are drawn to complete the page.
  </li><li>The display is halted until the user plays the entire page.
</li></ol><p></p>
<p>The interface was designed using a mapping of bit values - each kind
of note was essentially drawn as a square of 0s and 1s - 1 being a white
 pixel and 0 being a black pixel. In this fashion, all notes and clefs
were drawn.</p>

  <br><h4 id="desconnections">Keyboard and Microcontroller Interface </h4>
  <p>The keyboard contains up to 14 keys, and the microcontroller needs
to be able to detect the status of each key in real time. Directly
wiring each key to each port on the microcontroller would involve 14
distinct connections directly to microcontroller. This would create
massive number of wires directly to the microcontroller. To simplify the
 hardware interface directly to the microcontroller, we decided to use
two 8 bit 74HC166 Parallel-In-Serial-Out (PISO) shift register to sample
 parallel inputs from the keyboard and generate a serial output to
microcontroller. </p>
  <p>Each PISO shift register is capable of receiving 8 inputs and
generate 1 serial output. Two shift registers is used to sample 14
inputs, and two serial output wires are used to output to
microcontroller.</p>

  <i>How PISO shift registers work </i><br>
  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/shiftreg.png" alt="shiftreg" align="middle"> </p>
  <p>Parallel in refers to that the shift register can read all parallel
 inputs from D0 to D7 in to the shift register. At rising clock edge
when PE, parallel enable input (active-low), becomes low, new values are
 read. And at each subsequent rising clock edge, a value is shifted out
at Q7 beginning with D7. So at the first rising edge, we get the value
of D7. At the second rising edge, we get the value of D6. At each rising
 clock edge, we sample the data at the Q7 port. </p>

  <p><i> Sampling Rate PWM Clock and Parallel Enable Input Signals  </i></p>
  <p>We used the microcontroller to generate both the clock signal and the parallel enable input signals for the microcontroller. </p>
  <p>When we built the piano, we assumed that the fastest speed a person
 strikes keys is less than 1/10th of a second. So we decided to sample
10 inputs per sec. In Our design is able to sample  all keys per 100ms
(1s/10 = 0.1 sec). Since each shift register has 8 inputs, we need 8
cycles to serially shift out all the keys. Thus total of 8 cycles is
needed. Readings of the shifted out values also takes place at each
rising clock edge, and are done in parallel with the register shifting
to shift values out. Writes to shift registers occur at rising clock
edge and when PE is pulled low. We used timer2 to generate the PWM
signal for so we need 8x2=16 ticks. 100ms/16 = 6.25 ms. so the PWM must
run with a period of 6.25ms = 160 Hz. </p>
  <p>To achieve 160 Hz clock cycle we used Clear Timer on Capture mode.
We also toggle the output of the PWM. We set OCR2A to be 96, and when
OCR2A overflows it clears and becomes zero. We set the timer's prescalar
 to be 1024. So according to the equation below, we obtain 160 Hz for
the clock PWM signal.<br>
  16e6 / (1024 * OCR2A) = 160 Hz</p>

<br><h4 id="descomm">Communication Between Two Microcontrollers</h4>
<p>We used two microcontrollers in our project. Microcontroller 1
samples the keyboard input and generates the sound using Karplus-Strong
algorith. Microcontroller 2 generates the video and keeps track of how
well the player is playing the given song. Because of this, we needed to
 communicate the information of the keys that are pressed between the
two microcontrollers. Microcontroller 1 acts as the sender and
microcontroller 2 acts as the receiver. Neither can microcontroller 2
cannot send data, nor microcontroller 1 receive any data. Thus, the
communication is uni-directional. </p>

<p><i>UART </i></p>

<p>We used the built in UART serial communication to send and receive
data on both microcontrollers. The sender (microcontroller 1) uses UART
port0 Tx to send data to the receiver (microcontroller 2)'s UART port1
Rx. The UDRn register in the UART port both stores received data and
stores data that is about to send. The sender uses UDR0 to send data,
where as on the receiver's end data arrives in UDR1. The baud rate of
the UART is set to 57600, so that the receiver's end can keep up speed
with the speed of video generation. Any speed slower than that rate will
 cause significant lag in the video generation which affects the game
play. To coordinate communication between the two microcontrollers we
had different options. More, but we settled on the UART because UART has
 already been tested to be functional.</p>

<p><i>Data Packets</i></p>

<p>The entire key press status of the keyboard is contained in two packets. Each UART packet contains 8 bits or a <i>char</i>.
 We used a single bit to represent the status of each key on the
keyboard. Since there are 14 functioning keys on the keyboard we would
need at least 14 bits to represent the entire keyboard. We split the 14
status bits of the keyboard in half and each packet contains 7 keys.</p>

<p> The most significant bit of each packet is the packet header.
Packet0's packet header is set to 0, to indicates that there is still
more packets to follow. Packet1's packet header is set to 1 to indicate
that it is the last packet and no more packet after it. When the
receiver receives each respective packet, it would then know the order
of the packets. Bit 6 of packet0 represents the left most key on the
keyboard (C4), and bit 0 of packet1 represents the last key on the
keyboard (B5). Thus, our packets use Big-Endian format to represent the
key.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/packets_format.png" alt="keyboard"></p>

<br><h4 id="dessound">Sound Generation</h4>
<p><i>Karplus-Strong Algorithm</i></p>
<p>The Karplus-Strong Algorithm is a method for physical string
modeling. The algorithm feeds a delay line with white noise, then low
pass filters the shifted output of the delay line and adds it back into
itself. If we want to generate a tone of known frequency, we can use the
 following equation to determine the appropriate length of the delay
line:
<br>delay length = frequency of sampling / frequency of tone
<br>This method is straightforward to implement in software and produces realistic tones.</p>
<p><i>Implementation</i></p>
<p>Karplus-Strong was implemented in the ATMEGA1284P.
An emulated circular buffer and fractional delay unit implement the
delay line. The fractional delay unit must capture the fractional part
of the delay line length because the buffer must have an integer length.
The length of the buffer plus the length of the fractional delay
correspond to the length of the delay line in the following manner: <br>
delay length = delay (integer part) + delay (fractional part)<br>
Thus,<br>
delay (fractional) = fractional(frequency sampling/frequency tone) and <br>
length buffer = int(frequency sampling / frequency tone)<br>
Thus we can set set the buffer length and the fractional delay to
produce a tone of desired frequency. The table in the Appendix lists the
 buffer length and fractional delay for each supported note. The
fractional delay is shown in both fractional notation and in 8.8 fixed
point format. Fixed point format was used in the program because
operations on fixed point operands are much faster than operations on
floating point operands.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/circular_buffer.png"></p>

<p>As can be seen in the above image, the circular buffer is embedded
within a larger array, thus the buffer’s length can change dynamically.
The fractional delay can also change dynamically. Thus, tones of
different frequencies can be generated.
</p><p>The image below shows the Karplus-Strong unit that was
implemented in this project. The figure also shows the peripherals that
interact with the KS unit. These peripherals include the PWM, SPEAKER,
and INTERFACE.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/ks_block_diagram.png" width="700"></p>

<p>The KS unit was implemented within a C program. The program consists
of two sections: an ISR and an main while loop. Both sections are
periodic. The main while loop has a period of 50ms. Its purpose is to
execute a debounced read of the key array every 50ms. The ISR executes
at a frequency of 16KHz. Its purpose is to update the state of the
circular buffer. Essentially, this means doing the operations show in
the below image and then incrementing the pointers. When a pointer a
reaches the last element of the buffer, it wraps back around to the
first element.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/ks_isr.png"></p>

<p>When a new key is pressed, in the next execution of the ISR, the ISR
must change the buffer length and fractional delay so that the new tone
can be generated. To do this the ISR references two arrays. The ISR must
 also energize the entire buffer with white noise by populating each
element with uniformly random values. In subsequent executions of the
ISR, the buffer outputs high energy samples to the PWM, which are heard
as the tone of desired frequency. While the key is pressed down, the ISR
 decreases the damping so that the tone is sustained for a longer period
 as would happen in a real Piano. When the key is released, the damping
goes back to the normal level. In this case, as the system progresses,
the damping drives the energy of the buffer back down to zero and no
tone can be heard again. until we once again press a Piano key.</p>


<br><h4 id="desdiff">Design Difficulties and Choices</h4>
<p><i>Keyboard</i></p>

<p>Initially, we were considering modifying a commercial piano keyboard
by adding sensors at the bottom of the keys to detect key press.
However, after closely inspecting the commercial piano keyboard in lab,
we realized that modifying and debugging the keyboard would be onerous
and our time was running short. It was much faster to build our own
keyboard from scratch. We were very content with the results of our
keyboard and glove. The copper-strip coated glove also adds a steam-punk
 feeling to the entire project.</p>

<p><i>Microcontroller Communications</i></p>

<p>We initially planned on using a single microcontroller to achieve
keyboard reading, sound generation, and video interface. However, the
video generation has a very fast speed that placing sound generation and
 key press reading would distort the video signal. Additionally, adding
other interrupt service routines for keyboard reading or sound
generation would interfere with the interrupt service routine of the
video and creating a very flickering video. Due to these reasons, we
decided to use a separate microcontroller to handle the sound and key
inputs and using UART to send the status of the keys to the second
microcontroller.</p>

<p><i>Data Packet Frame Order</i></p>

<p>Since two packets are sent and each packet represents one half of the
 keyboard, it is important to get the order of the packets correct. We
initially did not include and packet headers to signify the order of the
 packets, because we assumed that if a packet gets sent first it will
also get received first. However, in reality, the first
packet that gets sent may not always be received as the first packet. To
 solve this problem, we made the most significant bit of each packet to
be the packet header which signifies the order that these packets should
 be received.</p>

<p><i>Song choice and Multiple Inputs</i></p>

 <p>Ideally, our program would be able to play multiple songs and let
the user choose between them. While we knew we didn't have enough time
to create a system that could read files and parse them, we explored the
 possibility of using a MIDI-style encoding to read music files.
However, it became clear that our effort was better spent improving
other aspects of our project and implementing a simpler way to encode
the music.</p>
 <p> Another tradeoff we made because of timing constraints was limiting
 the program to one input at a time. In this fashion, the user can only
hit one note at a time, so the music is restricted to simple melodies.
This can be easily extended in the future to allow for a more robust
system consistent with the needs of a pianist.</p>

<p><i>Design Methodology</i></p>
<p>An incremental and test-driven design methodology was used to extend
the provided code. We used Professor Bruce Land’s Karplus-Strong code as
 a jumping off point. We added some functionality to the code provided
by Professor Bruce Land.
BL One Karplus-Strong unit means that we can play one key at a time.
BL One string per note.
BL Two state key press debouncer.
BL Fixed point multiplication.
+    Dynamically decreasing the damping, while a Piano key is held down,
 means that a note can be  sustained.
+    Dynamically changing the buffer length and fractional delay means
that we can play many tones using only one Karplus-Strong unit.

<h3>Results</h3>

<br>
<h4 id="resspeed">Speed and Accuracy</h4>
<p><i>Screen Refresh Rate and Game Logic</i></p>
<p>The existing code we borrowed from Prof. Bruce Land used NTSC
protocols to generate visuals on a screen with an exact 60 Hz refresh
rate. Any logic for the displays or score generation are computed
between screen refreshes, so the code must be very straightforward and
as quick as possible. We found that the game logic ran quickly enough to
 make the video work seamlessly. However, once we added the UART, our
code took two refreshes to complete computation. This was a fixable
(though undesirable) affect - to negate it, we simply made our music
play twice as fast.</p>
<p>On the user's end, timing is only an issue when pressing keys. The
user's goal is to press the correct key at the correct time, and so it
is important on our end to be strict about timing but also allow for
natural human imprecision. As such, we allow for about a quarter-second
window before and after the expected key press.</p>

<p><i>Keyboard Sampling Rate </i></p>

<p>As mentioned in the design section, the PWM clock signal is at 160
Hz, which gives the ability to sample 10 changes in key press per
second. In other words, every 0.1 second we detect the status of all the
 keys. We chose this speed because we assumed that a person may not be
able to press the key more than 10 times per second. When we tested our
result, we found that we were able to get immediate response of the key
press with no observable delay. Thus, 10 samples per second for key
press is a feasible sampling rate.</p>

<p><i>Sound Generation</i></p>
<p>Our Piano has support for 14 notes. The figure below shows the
measured FFT for three different keys: the lowest frequency key C4, A4,
and the highest frequency key, B5. Notice that all tones exhibit
harmonics.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/fft_C4.png"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/fft_A4.png"></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/fft_B5.png"></p>

<p>The table below summarizes these measurements, lists the known
frequencies of the three keys, and gives the error. Some of this error
is introduced by the 8.8 point fixed format representation. However, for
 entertainment purposes, we believe the error is acceptable. The figure
below shows the effect of damping. As you can see, this particular tone,
 A4, decays in about 3 divs which corresponds to about 300ms. </p>

  <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="files/pwm_clock_latch.png" alt="pwm" align="middle"></p>

<p><i>Microcontroller Communications </i></p>

<p>The speed that UART sends and receives data is at 57600 bits per
second. This speed is much faster than the typical baud rate of 9600.
The reason we implemented this high baud rate is because we wanted to
match the speed of the video generation. In our original implementation,
 the UART baud rate is 9600 but it caused significant delays in the
execution of video generation. By increasing the baud rate to 57600, the
 UART receiver code can keep up speed with the speed of video
generation.</p>
<p></p>

<br><h4 id="ressafety">Safety</h4>
<p><i>Gloves and Keyboard Apparatus</i></p>

<p>The keyboard and the glove is safe for the user. Although charged,
the keyboard only goes up to 5V, which does not create any hazard for
users.</p>

<br><h4 id="resusability">Usability</h4>
<p>Our product is very intuitive for the pianist who is familiar with
basic technology, who is, coincidentally, our intended user. The
keyboard is laid out the same way a piano is, and the feedback is
relatively clear - if a note is played correctly, the score increases
immediately by 10 points. What might make it difficult for the average
pianist are the slightly wider keys and the lack of auditory tempo
feedback. Currently, the beat is displayed on the screen, which makes it
 difficult to monitor while also reading the music on the screen.</p>
<p>If the program is used by an untargeted user, it will likely not be
enjoyable (though the program will still work as intended). It can take
months for new musicians to learn to read music, and many more months to
 learn to sight-read it. While this is indeed a sight-reading assistant,
 it would be incredibly difficult for the new pianist to use it and find
 it useful.</p>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<small><a href="#consuccess">Success</a> | <a href="#constandards">Standards</a> | <a href="#conconsiderations">Considerations</a> | <a href="#conimprovements">Improvements</a></small><br>

<br><h4 id="consuccess">Success of the Project</h4>
<p>The final project was a great success. We were able to create a
keyboard comprised of keys that can play up to two-octaves. The real
time music sheet on the screen and score system provides the user a real
 time feedback of his or her performance.</p>

<br><h4 id="constandards">Conformity to Standards</h4>
<p>Our keyboard is constructed very similarly to a traditional piano.
The keys are in the standard fashion, but currently only span two
octaves. In other traditional musical fashion, the music is displayed on
 staves with a treble clef. This kind of musical display is standard
among all musicians, and the treble clef is often preferred by pianists.</p>

<br><h4 id="conconsiderations">Legal and Ethical Considerations</h4>
<p>The aim of this product is similar to popular video games like Guitar
 Hero and Rock Band. However, our product is very different in two ways:
 first, it uses a realistic piano keyboard, and second, it displays
music in a sheet music (traditional) fashion.</p>

<br><h4 id="conimprovements">Possible Improvements</h4>
<p><i>User Display Interface</i></p>
<p>While our product is fully functional, there are clearly some
improvements that can be made. Most noticeably, our program currently
only plays one song (Cornell's Alma Mater). One improvement that could
be made is to support reading MIDI files - perhaps by SD card - and
allowing the user to choose between the MIDI files on the SD card.
Secondly, implementing support for multiple-note input and multiple-note
 display would make the program much more robust. Currently, the
keyboard detects multiple inputs, but the sound generation and video
game logic only support one-hot inputs. </p>
<p>The music display can also be improved in a few ways. Currently,
sharps and flats aren't supported, which means only music in C major or A
 minor can be displayed. In addition, there is no feedback when a wrong
note is played - the score is the only feedback from input that is
visible on the display. Having some way of highlighting the current note
 you're supposed to be playing, or some feedback telling you what note
you pressed incorrectly, would be a helpful improvement to the system.</p>

<p><i>Keyboard</i></p>

<p>Our keyboard and gloves are very robust. The only downside is the
contact surface of the glove is not smooth. The ripples of the copper
tips of the glove sometimes trigger multiple key press on the keyboard.
The double key press issue could not be solved by conventional key press
 debouncing. An area of significant improvement would be to smooth out
the surface of the glove so to avoid double key strikes.</p>
<p>Our keyboard and gloves are very robust. The only downside is the

The double key press issue could not be solved by conventional key press
 debouncing. An area of significant improvement would be to smooth out
the surface of the glove so to avoid double key strikes.</p>
<p>Since the gloves make the user play the keyboard differently than on
an actual piano bare-hand. A potential improvement would be to build a
keyboard that does not require wearing gloves, which would be an attempt
 to simulate the condition of playing on a real piano. This would
involve more complicated sensor systems on the keyboard to detect the
press of the finger. Additionally, wearing the glove to play the piano
is cool. It gives a steam-punk feeling to the entire system.</p>

<p><i>Sound Generation</i></p>
<p>Play more than one key simultaneously. We would need one KS units for
 each key that we wanted to play simultaneously. Each KS unit runs
inside the ISR; therefore, having multiple KS units may lead to very
long ISR that do not meet the timing constraints. Two or three strings
per note. This would add realism; however, it would also make the ISR
longer because we would also need one KS unit per string. Better
debouncing. A larger state debouncer would reduce the number of false
double presses.
