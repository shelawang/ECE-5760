<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Our project connects a VGA monitor and a keyboard to an FPGA via an Altera DE2 development board to create a system resembling a personal computer. By simulating a traditional command line interface (CLI) on the VGA screen, users can perform certain operations through the CLI. Additionally, we utilized the DE2 board's built-in SD card reader to allow users to import, manipulate, and save portable data, effectively creating a simplified file system for the FPGA.</p>

</figure>

<p>The project uses the Pancake stack CPU to handle the high-level computations and tasks. Thus, one of the results of our work on this project was several new functions that can be added to programs written for Pancake. The project also includes some preliminary work interfacing the FPGA with the on-board SD card, without using Nios II or C. We have compiled a list of the new features that we implemented, which we believe may be helpful to future students. This list is found in the <a href="#confeatures">Useful Features</a> section of this page.</p>

<p>The figure below illustrates the major components of the system. The hardware interface consists of an FPGA on the DE2 board with an SD card reader connected to a PS/2 keyboard and a VGA monitor. We use a Pancake processor running on the FPGA to interface between the software (Syrup) and hardware (Verilog) components of our design. The FPGA accepts user input via the keyboard, interprets and processes the command through Pancake, and outputs the I/O through a command line interface (CLI) displayed on the VGA, in a way reminiscent of personal computers of yore.  The SD card reader sends and receives data in the same fashion.</p>

  When we started this project. The Pancake programming language came with very
  few functions. Consequently, part of our project is to extend the Pancake
  programming language library and to add many basic functions that should belong to a
  programming language. Our hope was to make the Pancake programming language friendlier
  to other users.
  <h4>Addition to the Pancake Programming Language Library</h4>
  The functions that we could be useful to the Pancake library include:
  <ul>
    <li><i>itoa</i>: printing number to vga in decimal format</li>
    <li><i>mod</i>: modular operation</li>
    <li><i>div</i>: integer division</li>
    <li><i>power</i>: exponentiation operation</li>
    <li><i>bubble_sort</i>: perform bubble sort on an array in ascending order</li>
    <li><i>print_array</i>: printing an array to vga</li>
    <li><i>max</i>: return the max of an array</li>
    <li><i>min</i>: return the min of an array</li>
    <li><i>reverse</i>: reverse an array</li>
  </ul>

  <b>itoa</b>: <i>printing number to vga in decimal format</i>
  <xmp>pseudo-code:
  itoa(int number)
  {
    // temp stores the temporary result
    temp = number;

    while(temp != 0)
    {
      // use mod operation to extract the unit digit and convert number to ASCII
      // representation and put it in the most significant bit of char_array
      // (later we will reverse the string)
      char_array[i] = toASCII(temp%10);

      // use integer division to shift the decimal number to the right
      // so the tens digit becomes the unit digit
      temp = temp/10;

      // increment the string array counter
      i++;
    }

    // after the above step, we would have the number reversed in char_array
    // e.g. if the number is 123, it would be displayed as 321
    // so reverse the char_array to get the correct representation
    reverse(char_array);

    print_to_vga(char_array);

  }
</xmp>
<b>mod</b>: <i>modular operation</i><br>
The modular function is implemented using subtractions. This algorithm
for modular is very standard.
<xmp>pseudo-code:
  mod(int x, int y)
  {
    result = x;
    while (result >= y)
      result = result - y;

    return result;
  }
</xmp>
<b>div</b>: <i>integer division</i>
Integer division operation is implemented using addition and subtraction
<xmp>pseudo-code:
  div(int x, int y)
  {
    temp = x;
    // this will eventually contains the result
    div_counter;

    while (temp >= y)
    {
      temp = temp - y;
      div_counter++;
    }

    return div_counter;
  }
</xmp>

<b>power</b>: <i>exponentiation operation</i> <br>
power (exponential) function is implemented using multiplication.
<xmp>pseudo-code:
  power(int x, int y)
  {
    result = 1;
    while(y > 0)
    {
      result = result * x;
      y--;
    }
    return result;
  }
</xmp>

<b>bubble_sort</b>: <i> perform bubble sort on an array in ascending order</i> <br>
  The bubble sort algorithm we implemented is a very standard bubble sort
  algorithm. In particular, our pancake version of the bubble sort is based
  on this <a href="http://www.java-examples.com/java-bubble-sort-example">one</a>:
<xmp>pseudo-code:
  bubble_sort(int[] array, int array_len)
  {
    // In bubble sort, we traverse the array from the first element to the last
    // array index and compare each neighbouring elements. The current element
    // is swapped with the next element if the next element is larger

    for(int i=0; i < n; i++)
    {
      for(int j=1; j < (n-i); j++)
      {
        if(array[j-1] > array[j])
        {
          swap(array[j-1], array[j]);
        }

      }
    }
  }
</xmp>
<b>print_array</b>: <i>printing an array to vga</i>
<xmp>pseudo-code:
  print_array(int[] array, int array_len)
  {
    for (int i = 0; i < array_len; i++)
    {
      // convert each array number to ascii
      char = toASCII(array[i]);

      // print to a specific location on the vga screen
      vga_putchar(char);
    }
  }
</xmp>

<b>max</b>: <i>return the max of an array</i>
<xmp>pseudo-code:
  max(int[] array, int array_len)
  {
    // traverse through the array and return the largest number

    max = array[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < array_len; i++)
    {
      if (array[i] > max)
        max = array[i];
    }
    return max;
  }
</xmp>

<b>min</b>: <i>return the min of an array</i>
<xmp>pseudo-code:
  max(int[] array, int array_len)
  {
    // traverse through the array and return the largest number

    min = array[0];

    for (int i = 1; i < array_len; i++)
    {
      if (array[i] < min)
        min = array[i];
    }
    return min;
  }
</xmp>

<b>reverse</b>: <i>reverse an array</i>
<xmp>pseudo-code:
  reverse(int[] array, int array_len)
  {
    // forward index traverse the array from the beginning to the end
    forw_idx = 0;
    // backward index traverse the array from the end to the beginning
    back_idx = array_len;

    // if forw_idx is greater than back_idx that means we have already
    // traversed and swapped every element in the array
    while(forw_idx < back_idx)
    {
      swap(array[forw_idx], array[back_idx]);
    }

  }
</xmp>

<h4>Function Specific to the Command Line Interface </h4>
In addition to those functions that could become an extension to the pancake programming
language library. We have also implemented functions that are specific to our project.
  <ul>
    <li><i>calculator           </i>: interactive calculator through the command line.</li>
    <li><i>clear_screen         </i>: clear the content on the command line screen and start the cursor from the top of the screen    </li>
    <li><i>clear_buffer         </i>: clear the buffer of line that the cursor is on. </li>
    <li><i>new_arr              </i>: creating a new array and store it in memory</li>
    <li><i>cp                   </i>: copy the array that read from the SD card to the memory</li>
    <li><i>type_character       </i>: interprets a key pressed on the keyboard </li>
    <li><i>type_character_helper</i>: displays a character on the VGA and adds it to the character buffer. </li>
    <li><i>draw_rectangle       </i>: draw a rectangle on the VGA, used to draw the blinking red cursor</li>
    <li><i>parse_file_cmd       </i>: implements the command <i>ls</i>, which reveals what files are on the SD card </li>
    <li><i>read_sd              </i>: read the content of a file contained on the SD card into the memory</li>
    <li><i>read_byte_sd         </i>: read a single byte from the SD card at a specific address</li>
    <li><i>write_sd             </i>: create and write a file to the SD card</li>
    <li><i>write_byte_sd        </i>: write a single byte to the SD card at a specific address</li>

  </ul>

<h5>Minimizing Code Size</h5>
<p></p>

<h5>Minimizing Input/Output Ports</h5>
<p>Once it is instantiated by an upper module, the "minicpu" module provided by Bruce represents the Pancake CPU and its input and output ports. One important thing to remember when using this module is that it has limited input and output ports &mdash; eight of each. Thus, one aspect of our design that we had to manage was what data we were sending in and out of the CPU so that we would not run out of ports. We originally based our initial code on Bruce's <a href="http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece5760/DE2/TinyCPU/Stack_machine_2013/VGA_sram_3cpu_2013.v" target="_blank">3 CPU Example</a>. Since we only needed one CPU, we found that after removing two of the three in the example, we could in fact free up several ports.</p>

<h5>Calculations</h5>
<p></p>

<h5>File System</h5>
<p></p>

<br><h4 id="ressafety">Safety</h4>
<p>Our system has no moving parts and consists solely of a DE2 development board, keyboard, VGA monitor, and SD card. These components are fairly familiar to the typical user, and we therefore do not foresee using our system as being any more dangerous than using a regular personal computer.</p>

<br><h4 id="resusability">Usability</h4>
<p>The system is usable and fun to use as a command line interface. For most commands, such as the calculator and array functions, there is no no perceivable delay between when the user enters the command when the response is displayed on the screen.</p>
<p>On the other hand, because of the way that we implemented the file system, most of the file-related commands, such as ls (list files), mk (make new file), and cat (show file contents), can take a second or two to complete.</p>
<p>A feature that would improve the usability of the system would be error messages. For example, if a user tries to show the contents of a file that does not exist, then the system would show on the screen that no such file exists. In the system's current state, the user does not receive any indication when a command or file name is not valid.</p>

<br><h4 id="consuccess">Success of the Project</h4>
<p>Our project was a success. While we were not able to implement all of the features that we had initially set out to create &mdash; such as a full-fledged interpreter and the ability to run programs directly from the SD card &mdash; our system is usable and has several other fun and useful features. In addition, we believe that future students may find some use in certain features that we implemented. These features are detailed in the <a href="#confeatures">Useful Features</a> section below.</p>

<br><h4 id="confeatures">Useful Features</h4>

<p>This section lists some of the features that we implemented for this project, which we believe may be useful for future students working with the Pancake stack CPU, an SD card, or a PS/2 keyboard on the DE2 development board.</p>

<h5>New Pancake functions</h5>
<p>@Victor: Discuss new functions</p>
  <ul>
  <li>
  </ul>
<h5>Pancake compilation script</h5>
<p>After making changes to the .cmp file in which the Pancake code is written, a multi-step process needs to be completed before the new code can be programmed onto the FPGA. The steps are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compile the Pancake code using Bruce Land's Syrup compiler in MATLAB.
<li>In Quartus II, select Processing > Update Memory Initialization File.
<li>Run the Assembler by selecting Processing > Start > Start Assembler.
<li>Program the FPGA.
</ol>
<p>Luckily, a full compile of the HDL is usually not required if the only changes were in the .cmp file; however, we decided to simplify steps 2 through 4 of this process by creating a <b>Windows</b> batch script called pancake_compile.bat. <!-- @SHELA TODO: Include link to the script here. --></p>
<p>A small amount of setup is required to use this script:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the "Quartus bin" directory on your computer. On the lab computers, this is C:/altera/11.0/quartus/bin.
<li>Copy this path to your clipboard.
<li>Follow the directions <a href="https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.xml" target="_blank">at this link</a> to find out how to modify the PATH system variable on your computer. (Follow the Windows 7 instructions for the lab computers.)
<li>Without adding any spaces, add a semicolon to the end of the value for PATH, then paste in the path to the Quartus bin directory.
<li>Click OK.
<li>Restart the Command Prompt, if you have it open.
</ol>

After this initial setup, reprogramming the FPGA after modifying the .cmp file is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Ensure the pancake_program.bat file and the .cmp file for your project are in the same directory.
<li>Navigate the Command Prompt to the directory that holds the .bat file.
<li>Compile the Pancake program using Bruce's MATLAB compiler.
<li>Enter into the Command Prompt "pancake_program.bat" (without quotes).
<li>Your new software should now be on the FPGA!
<li>Repeat steps 3-5 as necessary.
</ol>

<h5>SD Card controller</h5>
<p>Using a Verilog implementation of an SD card controller that we discovered online (see <a href="#references">References</a>), we were able to passably read and write an SD card using only Verilog (i.e., without using Nios II).</p>
<p>It is worth noting that in our implementation, a single "write" to the SD card in fact writes an entire 512-byte block, or "sector," of the SD card. Meanwhile, a "read" from the SD card reads the entire 512 bytes of a block but only keeps the last byte to display on the monitor. This scheme results in passable but certainly not optimal file accesses, and future work done using this SD card controller could include research into how to improve reads and writes.</p>
<p>Also note that the SD card controller may only reliably work with SD cards with storage capacity below 2 GB, as SD cards with more than 2 GB (high-capacity cards) require a different initialization sequence that is not handled in the controller used in this project.</p>

<p>Below is a brief overview of the inputs and outputs to the SD_Card module, which acts as the SD card controller in Verilog.</p>

<br><h4 id="constandards">Conformity to Standards</h4>
<p></p> @Richard?

<br><h4 id="conconsiderations">Legal and Ethical Considerations</h4>
<p>In developing this project, we followed the IEEE Code of Ethics, being careful in the development of our project to engineer our product in a responsible manner. We investigated the possible safety concerns that could come along with this project, and determined fully that our project would be safe even if accidents were to occur. We minimized risk in order to be consistent with public safety and welfare in mind.</p>
<p>In addition, we sought honest criticism at every stage of the development of our project, including from Bruce Land, our TA Deepak, and from our classmates to make our project better. At many points, we had small errors in our code or in our design, and we have acknowledged the contributions of all those involved in this project. We have been honest and realistic in the abilities and limitations of our project throughout. This is exemplified by our statements about how the project is limited in its current form, but there is plenty of room for extensibility. We have also been honest with the drawbacks of our project in terms of usability and modularity.</p>
<p>Finally, we have sought to improve understanding of technology through our project. We make all of the information available to the public in order to encourage others to build similar products if they are interested. This project is a good example of how computers were built from the ground up, and we hope that this reaches those who have similar interests and want to build similar systems.</p>

<br><h4 id="conimprovements">Possible Improvements</h4>
<h5>Error Messages</h5>
<p>Having meaningful error messages when a user enters an invalid command would improve the usability of our system. In our current system, if a user enters an invalid command or tries to display the contents of a file that does not exist, then the CLI simply does not output anything. In contrast, if a user enters an invalid command in Linux, for example, the CLI will display a message saying that the command was unsuccessful so that the user knows to try a different command.</p>

<h5>Efficient SD Card Access</h5>
<p>In the project's current form, a single "write" to the SD card actually writes an entire 512-byte "sector" of the SD card. Thus, the storage capacity on the SD card is reduced by a factor of 512, while the time required to read and write from the card is increased by a factor of 512. Improvements to reading and writing the SD card would greatly enhance the usability of the system, because file reads and writes would be much faster, and users would have the ability to create more files.</p>

<h5>Hierarchical File System</h5>
<p>Customizable file names and the ability to create and navigate between directories would make our file system seem more like that of a regular computer. A real bonus would be to implement FAT32-style reading and writing so that files could even be transfered between the FPGA and other computers with SD card slots.</p>
