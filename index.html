<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Our project connects a VGA monitor and a keyboard to an FPGA via an Altera DE2 development board to create a system resembling a personal computer. By simulating a traditional command line interface (CLI) on the VGA screen, users can perform certain operations through the CLI. Additionally, we utilized the DE2 board's built-in SD card reader to allow users to import, manipulate, and save portable data, effectively creating a simplified file system for the FPGA.</p>

<p>The project uses the Pancake stack CPU to handle the high-level computations and tasks. Thus, one of the results of our work on this project was several new functions that can be added to programs written for Pancake. The project also includes some preliminary work interfacing the FPGA with the on-board SD card, without using Nios II or C. We have compiled a list of the new features that we implemented, which we believe may be helpful to future students. This list is found in the <a href="#confeatures">Useful Features</a> section of this page.</p>

<br/><h4 id="desinterface">Block Diagram</h4>
<p>The figure below illustrates the major components of the system. The hardware interface consists of an FPGA on the DE2 board with an SD card reader connected to a PS2 keyboard and a VGA monitor. We use a Pancake processor running on the FPGA to interface between the software (Syrup) and hardware (Verilog) components of our design. The FPGA accepts user input via the keyboard, interprets and processes the command through Pancake, and outputs the I/O through a command line interface (CLI) displayed on the VGA, in a way reminiscent of personal computers of yore.  The SD card reader sends and receives data in the same fashion.</p>

<br><h4 id="constandards">Conformity to Standards</h4>
<p></p>

<br><h4 id="conconsiderations">Legal and Ethical Considerations</h4>
<p>In developing this project, we followed the IEEE Code of Ethics, being careful in the development of our project to engineer our product in a responsible manner. We investigated the possible safety concerns that could come along with this project, and determined fully that our project would be safe even if accidents were to occur. We minimized risk in order to be consistent with public safety and welfare in mind.</p>
<p>In addition, we sought honest criticism at every stage of the development of our project, including from Bruce Land, our TA Deepak, and from our classmates to make our project better. At many points, we had small errors in our code or in our design, and we have acknowledged the contributions of all those involved in this project. We have been honest and realistic in the abilities and limitations of our project throughout. This is exemplified by our statements about how the project is limited in its current form, but there is plenty of room for extensibility. We have also been honest with the drawbacks of our project in terms of usability and modularity.</p>
<p>Finally, we have sought to improve understanding of technology through our project. We make all of the information available to the public in order to encourage others to build similar products if they are interested. This project is a good example of how computers were built from the ground up, and we hope that this reaches those who have similar interests and want to build similar systems.</p>
